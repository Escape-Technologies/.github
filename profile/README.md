## Hello! üëã 

[Escape](https://escape.tech) is the API discovery and security platform built to help Application Security engineers. 

Securing APIs shouldn't be this hard. With Escape, you can quickly inventory all APIs, detect OWASP Top 10 and complex logic flaws at scale, and adopt security in CI/CD.  No agent, no proxy are required. And we assist developers with detailed remediation snippets üòâ

## Join our team ü§ù 

We believe it‚Äôs time to bring more AI-driven innovation to cybersecurity, and we'd love your help in building this dream! Want to join our adventure? Check out our [**Careers**](https://jobs.escape.tech) page!

## Open source repos üßô

At Escape, in addition to our work on API security, we've also been developing some fantastic open-source projects. Let us introduce you to all of them üöÄ

- [API Security Academy](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-security-academy), an interactive platform dedicated to helping you learn how to secure #graphql applications.

- [Goctopus](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/goctopus), a GraphQL endpoint discovery and fingerprinting tool.

- [GraphQL wordlist](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-wordlist), the only GraphQL wordlist for #pentesting you'll ever need. Operations, field names, type names... It was collected on more than 60k distinct GraphQL schemas.

- [GraphQL Armor](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor/), a middleware for Apollo GraphQL Server that adds a security layer to any GraphQL endpoint in minutes. It's also compatible with The Guild Software's Envelop universal plugin system.

- [GraphMan](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphman),  a tool that helps you to scaffold a Postman collection for a GraphQL API. Compatible with Postman & Insomnia from Kong Inc.

- [Graphinder](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphinder), a lightweight and blazing-fast GraphQL endpoint finder, making penetration testing on GraphQL much faster 

- [Mookme](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/mookme), a git hook manager, designed monorepos for dealing with different projects and languages, automated filtering, and ease of configuration and setup.

- [PyMultiAuth](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/py-multiauth), an open-source Python library that allows users to authenticate and reauthenticate automatically.
